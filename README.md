AI-Powered Resume Analyzer Bot

Hi there! 
This is a personal project I built to explore how we can use LLMs like LLaMA (via Groq) along with LangChain and LangGraph to analyze resumes smartly and provide feedback, all through a simple Streamlit interface.

What It Does

This app lets you:
- Upload your resume (PDF)
- Automatically extract important info like name, skills, education, etc.
- Score your resumeâ€™s technical strength
- Get 3 suggestions to improve your resume

All of this is powered by a multi-step LangGraph pipeline and an LLM from **Groq**, using the blazing-fast **Mixtral** model.



Tech Stack
